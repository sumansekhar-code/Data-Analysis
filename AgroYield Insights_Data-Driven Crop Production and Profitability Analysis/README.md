# AgroYield Insights: Data-Driven Crop Production and Profitability Analysis


## 🚜 Domain: Agriculture | 📊 Tools: Python • SQL Server • Power BI • Excel

## Overview
Agriculture plays a crucial role in a country’s economy — and data can make it smarter.
This project, AgroYield Insights, focuses on understanding how various factors such as rainfall, fertilizer use, and crop type influence agricultural yield and profitability across different regions of India.

By leveraging data analytics and visualization, this project empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions for better productivity and resource utilization.

## Objective
To analyze crop yield, weather, soil, and fertilizer usage data to identify:
    - Top-performing crops and states
    - The relationship between weather and yield
    - Fertilizer efficiency for different crops
    - Year-over-year production trends
    - Actionable insights for boosting future crop productivity


## Scope of Work
    - Integrate multiple datasets: crop yield, rainfall, fertilizer, and production data.
    - Clean, process, and analyze the data using Python and SQL Server.
    - Build a multi-page Power BI dashboard that provides end-to-end agricultural insights.
    - Perform correlation and trend analysis between rainfall, fertilizer use, and yield.
    - Present executive, regional, and environmental insights through visual storytelling.

## Tools & Workflow
Tool	    Purpose
Excel       Initial data cleaning and validation
Python      (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) - Data preprocessing, missing value imputation, and correlation/trend analysis
SQL Server	Data storage, joins, and query-based reporting
Power BI	Interactive dashboards, KPIs, and storytelling visuals

## Key Insights
    - 🌾 Wheat, Rice, and Maize dominate national production, but Pulses show best fertilizer efficiency.
    - 🌦 Moderate rainfall regions achieved up to 18% higher yield than drought-prone states.
    - 💰 Overuse of fertilizer doesn’t guarantee better yield — efficiency peaks at moderate use.
    - 🧭 Maharashtra and Punjab emerged as top performers, contributing 30%+ to national yield.

## Why This Project Stands Out
    - ✅ Real-world agriculture + analytics problem solving
    - ✅ Strong end-to-end pipeline (Excel → Python → SQL → Power BI)
    - ✅ Demonstrates data storytelling, not just visualization
    - ✅ Highlights predictive thinking for future yield optimization
    - ✅ Perfect for Data Analyst / BI Analyst / Data Science portfolios

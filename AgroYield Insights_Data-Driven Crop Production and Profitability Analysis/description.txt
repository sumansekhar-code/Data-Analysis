🚜 Option 1: Agriculture Domain
🌾 Project Title:
"AgroYield Insights: Data-Driven Crop Production and Profitability Analysis"

🎯 Objective:
To analyze crop yield, weather, soil, and fertilizer usage data to understand factors influencing agricultural productivity and provide actionable insights for improving crop output and profitability.

🧩 Scope:
Combine data from multiple sources (crop, soil, rainfall, fertilizer use, pricing)
Identify top-performing crops and regions
Analyze weather–yield correlations
Predict next season’s best crop (basic predictive analytics)
Create an interactive Power BI dashboard for decision-making

⚙️ Tools & Workflow:
SQL Server: Data storage, joins, cleaning large tables (crop, region, weather, sales)
Python: Data preprocessing, correlation analysis, trend analysis (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
Power BI: Dashboard with KPIs (Yield per Acre, Fertilizer Efficiency, Regional Output)
Excel: Data cleaning and initial validation

📊 Possible Insights & Reports:
Region-wise crop yield comparison
Fertilizer cost vs crop output
Weather impact on yield
Year-over-year production trends
Profitability by crop type

🚀 Why it’s impactful:
Agriculture + Analytics = real-world social impact
Shows your ability to work with environmental data and predictive modeling
Perfect for portfolios aimed at Data Analyst / Data Scientist roles



🧠 Step 1: Problem Definition & Planning

Goal:
Understand what questions you want to answer.
You already have your objective, so now define your analysis questions, such as:
Which crops are most profitable by region?
How does rainfall or temperature affect yield?
What is the fertilizer efficiency for each crop?
Which crop should be prioritized for next season?

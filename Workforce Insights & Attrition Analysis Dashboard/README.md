# Workforce Insights & Attrition Analysis

## Overview
The **Workforce Insights & Attrition Analysis** project focuses on analyzing employee turnover within an organization. By analyzing key employee attributes and historical data, the project aims to uncover patterns and insights that can help HR teams make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention and reduce attrition rates. The project uses **Python**, **Power BI**, and statistical analysis techniques to evaluate various factors that influence employee departure.

## Project Idea
The project analyzes employee attrition across different departments, job roles, age groups, and other relevant attributes to identify key drivers of employee turnover. The goal is to:
- Understand the factors contributing to attrition.
- Identify patterns in employee behavior that lead to higher attrition.
- Provide HR teams with actionable insights to retain talent and reduce turnover.
